# About

This is a fork of waymonad that hopes to get it working again.
Hopefully we'll get it merged back into waymonad/waymonad eventually.

# Contributing

After you've installed [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) you can simply run `nix-shell`
in the root of the project, after which you can run `cabal repl`.
This is the **main** focus, since right now, things likely won't
typecheck correctly, because dependencies have been updated, etc,
so after running `cabal repl` you can try to fix the errors you see
one by one!

# Old README

## waymonad

We all love tiling window managers and most of all we love [xmonad](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad).
As you may know, [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) is trying to replace X11.

This brings problems for us, since xmonad will not work with the new architecture.

This project is intended to provide a wayland based desktop which shares the ideals and experience from xmonad.

### [WIP]: This is work in Progress.
#### There's no bar/quality of life

If you need to lock your session: swaylock should work perfectly fine.
Currently that's not set up in any automatic way though.

Swaybg should work, and my waymonad-clients has a somewhat usable background application.

#### "Minor" things

* There is barely any documentation so unless you are familiar with Haskell (and preferably xmonad) this may be rather hard to get comfortable with.

-----
## "Install" (compile and execute locally):

To test this, you need `wlroots` installed.
This currently only builds with the `new-build` feature of cabal-install. `stack` is (not yet) supported.

 * git clone --recursive https://github.com/ongy/waymonad
 * cd waymonad
 * `[PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig] cabal new-build`
 
 #### For unprivileged install:
 * Configure wlroots with: `meson build --prefix=<your prefix>`
 * ninja -C build install
 * `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<your prefix>/lib/pkgconfig cabal new-build`
 
 ---
#### For the little documentation there is for now: 
 * cabal new-haddock

-----

#### What this is NOT

* A straight upgrade path
* A reimplementation of xmonad
* A full implementation containing DRM and other backends

#### What this is

* Implemented in Haskell
* predictable layouting
* based on the compositor library [wlroots](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/wlroots)
